CHANGES

* **koRpus** package now has a heavy link to language modules.

textstem 0.1.0 - 0.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `lemmatize_strings` and `stem_strings` would split numbers with decimals

  (see issue #3).



textstem 0.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

This package is  collection of tools that stem and lemmatize text.  Stemming is
a process that removes endings such as suffixes.  Lemmatization is the process
of grouping inflected forms together as a single base form.
